> **PayRam** is a self-hosted, multi-chain crypto payments platform that runs on your infrastructure‚Äîfeaturing a Private Stablecoin Gateway for USDT/USDC‚Äîand a no-server-keys architecture where a family of smart contracts orchestrates fund movements while sweeping funds to cold wallets by policy.




## Why PayRam

* **Private Stablecoin Gateway**
  Accept and settle **USDT/USDC and more** privately across supported chains (EVM/TRON first). Bitcoin also supported.

* **No Private Keys on the Server**
  PayRam‚Äôs core philosophy: **no keys on the server**. A coordinated set of smart contracts executes deposits, confirmations, and policy-driven movements‚Äî**keys never touch the app servers**, and funds are **swept to cold storage** on thresholds or schedules. (Only Gas wallet needs keys for basic ops)

* **Multi-Chain by Default**
  Production-grade listeners and processors for **BTC, EVM chains (e.g., Ethereum/Base), TRON, TON**.

* **Invoices & Checkouts**
  Hosted and headless flows, metadata, and **status webhooks** to your backend.

* **Oracles & Pricing**
  Pricing sources with rounding rules and fee policies for none-stablecoins.

* **No Account Freezing**
  It's your gateway and your funds. Nobody can stop you.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Compliance note:** PayRam is infrastructure. You are responsible for KYC/AML/sanctions compliance in your jurisdiction.
